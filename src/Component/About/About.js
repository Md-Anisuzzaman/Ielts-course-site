                <p>The IELTS Bangladesh builds connections, understanding and trust between people in the BD and other countries through arts and culture, education and the English language.
                    We help young people to gain the skills, confidence and connections they are looking for to realise their potential and to participate in strong and inclusive communities. We support them to learn English, to get a high-quality education and to gain internationally
                    recognised qualifications. Our work in arts and culture stimulates creative expression and exchange and nurtures creative enterprise.
                    We have been working in Bangladesh since 1951. Every year we connect with thousands of students, educators, policymakers, academics, partners, local government, UK diaspora and civil society in Bangladesh.</p>
